<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>About PurpleAir</h2>
<h3>Q: How do PurpleAir sensors work, and what do they measure?</h3>
<p>A: PurpleAir sensors measure airborne particulate matter (PM). Particulate matter describes solid particles suspended in air; this includes dust, smoke, and other organic and inorganic particles. PurpleAir sensors use laser particle counters to count the number of particles by particle sizes 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 &mu;m, and use the count data to calculate mass concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.</p>
<p>PurpleAir sensors use laser counters to measure particulate matter in real time. A laser counter uses a fan to draw a sample of air past a laser beam. Any particles in the air will reflect some light from the laser beam onto a detection plate, like dust shimmering in a sunbeam. The reflection is measured as a pulse by the detection plate, and the length of the pulse determines the size of the particle while the number of pulses determines the particle count. These particle counts are used to calculate the mass concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 for standard indoor (CF_1) and outdoor particles.</p>


<h2>Registration</h2>
<h3>Q: What’s the difference between the Associated Email and the Owner’s Email?</h3>
<p>A: The Associated Email is the email address used by the buyer to complete the purchase of the sensor and is used as a reference. </p>
<p>This email address is paired with the MAC address of all sensors bought in the same transaction, and must be used as the Associated Email to register the sensor. You may use any email address as the Owner's Email address. When registering an email will be sent to both email addresses with the registration details.</p>

<h3>Q: What is the difference between a public and a private sensor?</h3>
<p>A: When registering a sensor, you have the choice of making it either public or private. If you choose to make your sensor public, anyone can view your sensor on the PurpleAir map.</p>
<p>If you register your device as private, only you (and those with whom you share the link provided in the registration email) will be able to see your sensor on our map.</p>

<h2>Wifi Configuration</h2>
<h3>Q: How can I configure my sensor to WiFi?</h3>
<p>NOTE:The WiFi configuration process is the same for all PurpleAir sensors!</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.It’s best to configure your sensor to WiFi with the router, computer/phone/tablet, and sensor in the same room. After plugging in your device and confirming it is receiving power (look for the dim red glow inside the sensor housing, or for indoor sensors, make sure the device itself is glowing), on a WiFi-enabled device, open the list of available WiFi networks.</li>
  <li>2.Connect to the sensor's network, PurpleAir-****. The **** is a 2-4 character code determined by your sensor. (It may take up to up to 10 minutes after the sensor is plugged in for this network to appear.)</li>
  <li>3.Depending on your operating system or device, you may get a pop-up window or a message to sign in to the network. If you receive a message to sign in to the network, press it to make the pop-up window appear. The pop-up window will list all available WiFi networks.</li>
  <li>Note: If the pop-up window does not appear, after making sure you've selected the "PurpleAir-****" network and waiting a bit, if you still don't get the pop-up, try opening a web browser and loading a webpage. If you are indeed connected to the PurpleAir network, this will load the sensor interface with the WiFi settings for the sensor. Another option is to open a webpage and in the address bar, enter the default IP address for the sensor: http://192.168.4.1/config.</li>
  <li>4.Choose the WiFi network you would like the sensor to connect to, enter the password for that network, and click Save. A hidden WiFi network can be entered by selecting the option at the bottom of the list.</li>
  <li>5.The WiFi status bar will turn green once your PurpleAir sensor is connected to WiFi and transmitting data. Once your device is configured to your local WiFi network, it will no longer appear in the list of available networks - the fact that it has disappeared means that the sensor is successfully configured to WiFi.</li>
</ul>
