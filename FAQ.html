<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>About PurpleAir</h2>
<h3>Q: How do PurpleAir sensors work, and what do they measure?</h3>
<p>A: PurpleAir sensors measure airborne particulate matter (PM). Particulate matter describes solid particles suspended in air; this includes dust, smoke, and other organic and inorganic particles. PurpleAir sensors use laser particle counters to count the number of particles by particle sizes 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 &mu;m, and use the count data to calculate mass concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.</p>
<p>PurpleAir sensors use laser counters to measure particulate matter in real time. A laser counter uses a fan to draw a sample of air past a laser beam. Any particles in the air will reflect some light from the laser beam onto a detection plate, like dust shimmering in a sunbeam. The reflection is measured as a pulse by the detection plate, and the length of the pulse determines the size of the particle while the number of pulses determines the particle count. These particle counts are used to calculate the mass concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 for standard indoor (CF_1) and outdoor particles.</p>


<h2>Registration</h2>
<h3>Q: What’s the difference between the Associated Email and the Owner’s Email?</h3>
<p>A: The Associated Email is the email address used by the buyer to complete the purchase of the sensor and is used as a reference. </p>
<p>This email address is paired with the MAC address of all sensors bought in the same transaction, and must be used as the Associated Email to register the sensor. You may use any email address as the Owner's Email address. When registering an email will be sent to both email addresses with the registration details.</p>

<h3>Q: What is the difference between a public and a private sensor?</h3>
<p>A: When registering a sensor, you have the choice of making it either public or private. If you choose to make your sensor public, anyone can view your sensor on the PurpleAir map.</p>
<p>If you register your device as private, only you (and those with whom you share the link provided in the registration email) will be able to see your sensor on our map.</p>
